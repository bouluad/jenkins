# Jenkins Migration Plan: From Azure AKS to Private Kubernetes Cluster

## 1. Synchronization of Jenkins Jobs and Pipelines
- **Risk**: Jenkins jobs and pipelines may diverge between the old and new instances if both are active simultaneously.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) to manage job configurations in version control, ensuring both instances use the same configuration files.
  - Synchronize job configurations frequently between the old and new instances until the cutover.
  - Lock job configurations on the old instance once the new instance is in the final validation stage to prevent further changes.

## 2. Credential and Secret Management
- **Risk**: Secrets and credentials may not be properly transferred to the new instance, leading to failures in job execution.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Export all credentials from the old Jenkins instance:
    ```groovy
    import jenkins.model.*
    import hudson.util.Secret
    import com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.*
    import com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.impl.*
    import com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.domains.*
    
    def credentialsMap = [:]
    
    def creds = CredentialsProvider.lookupCredentials(
        com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.Credentials.class,
        Jenkins.instance,
        null,
        null
    )
    
    creds.each { c ->
        def credentialData = [:]
        credentialData['type'] = c.getClass().getName()
    
        if (c instanceof com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.impl.UsernamePasswordCredentialsImpl) {
            credentialData['username'] = c.username
            credentialData['password'] = Secret.toString(c.password)
        } else if (c instanceof com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.impl.StringCredentialsImpl) {
            credentialData['secret'] = Secret.toString(c.secret)
        } else if (c instanceof com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.sshcredentials.impl.BasicSSHUserPrivateKey) {
            credentialData['username'] = c.username
            credentialData['privateKey'] = c.privateKey
            if (c.passphrase) {
                credentialData['passphrase'] = Secret.toString(c.passphrase)
            }
        } else if (c instanceof com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.impl.CertificateCredentialsImpl) {
            credentialData['alias'] = c.keyStoreSource.keyStoreAlias
            credentialData['password'] = Secret.toString(c.password)
            credentialData['certificate'] = "(binary content)"
        } else if (c instanceof com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.awscredentials.AWSCredentialsImpl) {
            credentialData['accessKey'] = c.accessKey
            credentialData['secretKey'] = Secret.toString(c.secretKey)
        } else if (c instanceof org.jenkinsci.plugins.docker.commons.credentials.DockerServerCredentials) {
            credentialData['username'] = c.username
            credentialData['password'] = Secret.toString(c.password)
            credentialData['email'] = c.email
            credentialData['serverAddress'] = c.serverAddress
        } else if (c instanceof com.google.jenkins.plugins.credentials.oauth.GoogleRobotPrivateKeyCredentials) {
            credentialData['accountId'] = c.accountId
            credentialData['privateKey'] = "(private key not displayed)"
        } else {
            credentialData['unsupportedType'] = true
        }
    
        credentialsMap[c.id] = credentialData
    }
    
    println(credentialsMap)
    ```
  - Import credentials into the new Jenkins instance using the appropriate secure methods.
  - Validate that all credentials (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens, passwords) work correctly in the new environment by running test jobs.

## 3. Consistency in Plugins and Dependencies
- **Risk**: Inconsistencies in plugins and dependencies between the old and new Jenkins instances could lead to job failures.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Ensure the new Jenkins instance has the same versions of plugins and dependencies as the old instance:
    ```bash
    # Example command to list installed plugins in old Jenkins
    curl -s 'http://old-jenkins-instance/pluginManager/api/json?depth=1&tree=plugins[shortName,version]' > plugins.json

    # Example command to install plugins from a list
    jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins plugins.json
    ```
  - Use `plugin.txt` or a similar file to automate the installation of required plugins.
  - Test all critical jobs on the new instance to ensure that plugin-related issues are identified and resolved early.

## 4. Data Migration and History Preservation
- **Risk**: Build history, artifacts, and logs may not be fully migrated to the new instance, leading to loss of historical data.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Manually transfer build history and artifacts if needed. For example:
    ```bash
    # Copy build artifacts from old Jenkins to new Jenkins
    rsync -avz /var/jenkins_home/jobs/ old-jenkins:/var/jenkins_home/jobs/
    ```
  - Consider archiving old build data in an external storage solution if direct migration is not feasible.
  - Document and communicate any decisions regarding which historical data will or will not be migrated.

## 5. User Access and Authentication Configuration
- **Risk**: Users may experience issues with authentication or permissions on the new Jenkins instance.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Replicate the authentication setup (e.g., GitHub OAuth, LDAP) from the old instance to the new one.
  - Conduct user access tests to ensure that permissions are correctly configured and that all users can access their necessary resources.
  - Communicate any changes in access procedures to users before they begin using the new instance.

## 6. Network and Integration Testing
- **Risk**: Network configurations and integrations with external systems (e.g., SCM, Docker, ArgoCD) might not work correctly in the new environment.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Validate network connectivity and firewall rules for the new Jenkins instance:
    ```bash
    # Test network connectivity
    curl -I https://external-service.example.com
    ```
  - Run test builds to verify that SCM integrations, Docker image pulling/pushing, and ArgoCD deployments work as expected.
  - Ensure that any IP whitelisting or DNS changes required for the new environment are implemented and tested.

## 7. Parallel Run and Cutover
- **Risk**: The process of cutting over from the old instance to the new instance might result in confusion or data discrepancies.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Define a clear cutover plan, including the exact time when users should stop using the old instance and switch to the new one.
  - Perform a final synchronization of job configurations and credentials right before the cutover.
  - Keep the old instance in a read-only mode for a period after cutover to allow for reference but prevent changes.

## 8. Monitoring and Performance
- **Risk**: Performance issues might arise in the new Jenkins instance, affecting build times and reliability.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the performance of the new Jenkins instance:
    ```bash
    # Example command to deploy Prometheus and Grafana
    kubectl apply -f prometheus-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f grafana-deployment.yaml
    ```
  - Compare performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage) between the old and new instances to identify any discrepancies.
  - Adjust resource allocations in the private Kubernetes cluster as necessary to ensure optimal performance.

## 9. Communication and User Training
- **Risk**: Users might be unaware of the migration timeline or unfamiliar with the new instanceâ€™s setup.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regularly communicate the migration plan, timeline, and any expected impacts to all Jenkins users.
  - Provide documentation or training sessions for users to familiarize them with any changes in the new instance.
  - Offer support during the transition period to help users with any issues they encounter on the new instance.

## 10. Rollback Plan
- **Risk**: Unforeseen issues with the new instance may necessitate a rollback to the old Jenkins instance.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Keep the old Jenkins instance fully operational and accessible until the new instance is confirmed to be stable.
  - Document a clear rollback plan, including steps to re-enable the old instance and redirect users back to it if needed.
  - Ensure that all data and configurations on the old instance remain intact and unchanged during the migration.

## 11. Compliance and Security Verification
- **Risk**: The new Jenkins environment may introduce compliance or security risks if not properly configured.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Conduct a security audit of the new Jenkins instance to ensure it meets all security and compliance requirements.
  - Review configurations for encryption, access control, and data handling to ensure compliance with organizational policies.
  - Engage with the security team to perform a penetration test on the new instance before the final cutover.
